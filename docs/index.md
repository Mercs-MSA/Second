_SECOND_ is an app to track the attendance of students, mentors, coaches and volunteers to/from events for the purpose of being able to note hours given.

Members and activity logs are stored and managed on a Google Sheet, eliminating the need for complex databases. The app will continue to function locally if the internet connection is lost, and will sync changes when the connection is restored.
