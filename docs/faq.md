# FAQ

## What's the difference between the global admin PIN and an admin member's PIN?

The global admin PIN is used to access the **app's configuration settings and logs**. It is a universal PIN that allows authorized users to manage the app's settings.

An admin member's PIN, on the other hand, is specific to individual admin members stored in the Google Sheet. **This PIN is used for clocking in and out if the admin does not use RFID.**

## What's the difference between an admin member and a regular member?

Admin members are configured by default to require a PIN for manual (non-RFID) clock in/out, while student members do not require a PIN.

## How do I reset the password of an admin member?

Delete the member's "Password Hash" from the Members workbook within the Google Sheet. The member will be prompted to set a new PIN the next time they try to clock in/out.

## Can a physical keyboard be used with the app?

No, a physical keyboard will not work with the app, even if RFID is disabled. The app will only work using the virtual keyboard. This also applies to desktop platforms.
